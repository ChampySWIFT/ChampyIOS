We take security measures to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure. However, no system can be completely secure.

Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information will always

remain secure. Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and should avoid sending personal information

through insecure email. Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission's website at http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm for information about how

to protect yourself against identity theft.

Terms of Use. Also, whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly-viewable pages, that information will be publicly available and can

be collected and used by others. For example, if you post your email address, you may receive unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads your

posting or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your

personal information.
